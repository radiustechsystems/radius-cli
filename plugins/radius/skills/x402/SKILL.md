  Integrate x402 HTTP payment protocol on Radius. Use when the user wants to:
  monetize an API with per-request micropayments, add HTTP 402 payment gating to endpoints,
  consume a paid x402 API, sign x402 payment headers, integrate with a facilitator service,
  implement EIP-2612 permit + Permit2 payment signing, build pay-per-call services on Radius
  using SBC token, or set up x402 middleware. Covers both server-side (protect your endpoints
  with payment gating) and client-side (sign and pay for x402-protected endpoints). Use
  `radius-cli wallet pay` for terminal consumption, `radius-sdk/client` for app buyers,
  and `radius-sdk/hono` for Hono sellers.

# x402 Integration on Radius

## What this Skill is for

Use this Skill when the user asks to:
- Add x402 payment gating to an API endpoint
- Monetize an API with per-request micropayments
- Build a pay-per-call or pay-per-query service
- Consume or call an x402-protected API
- Sign x402 payment headers (EIP-2612 + Permit2)
- Integrate with an x402 facilitator service
- Understand the x402 HTTP 402 payment flow
- Set up x402 middleware for a server

**Not this Skill:** For dApp development on Radius (wagmi, Foundry, event watching), use the **radius-dev** skill. For getting testnet/mainnet tokens, use the **dripping-faucet** skill. For direct on-chain payment patterns (pay-per-visit paywalls, streaming payments) that don't use x402 facilitators, see radius-dev's [micropayments.md](../radius-dev/references/micropayments.md). For platform deployment, hosting, domains, or infrastructure operations, use the relevant deployment skill (for example Cloudflare, Wrangler, Railway) after the x402 endpoint behavior is implemented.

## Protocol overview

x402 is an HTTP-native micropayment protocol. The buyer signs a payment authorization; a facilitator submits settlement. A buyer may also need a one-time on-chain Permit2 approval when gas sponsoring is unavailable. The SDK selects the compatible signing method from the server's challenge.

```

For a v2 `exact` Permit2 offer with `eip2612GasSponsoring`, the buyer signs an EIP-2612 permit for the one-time approval and a Permit2 transfer authorization. Without sponsoring, the SDK can send an approval transaction. Other supported offers use different signatures: v2 `exact` may use EIP-3009, v2 `upto` uses Permit2, and v1 `exact` uses EIP-3009. `upto` authorizes a maximum; the actual charge comes from the payment receipt. Use the SDK to select and encode the offered method.

HTTP x402 v2 carries protocol data in headers:
- `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` — server to client, base64-encoded payment requirements
- `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` — client to server, base64-encoded signed payment payload
- `PAYMENT-RESPONSE` — server to client, base64-encoded settlement result

## Configuration

All x402 integration on Radius uses these constants:

| Setting | Mainnet | Testnet |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **CAIP-2 network** | `eip155:723487` | `eip155:72344` |
| **SBC token** | `0x33ad9e4BD16B69B5BFdED37D8B5D9fF9aba014Fb` | same |
| **SBC decimals** | 6 | 6 |
| **Permit2 contract** | `0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3` | same |
| **x402 Permit2 Proxy** | `0x402085c248EeA27D92E8b30b2C58ed07f9E20001` | same |
| **Facilitator URL** | `https://facilitator.radiustech.xyz` | `https://facilitator.testnet.radiustech.xyz` |
| **EIP-2612 domain name** | `Stable Coin` | `Stable Coin` |
| **EIP-2612 domain version** | `1` | `1` |

> **Facilitator note:** Radius-operated facilitators are the recommended defaults for both
> mainnet and testnet. Check `/supported` before integrating to confirm the target network,
> transfer method (`permit2`), and extensions such as `eip2612GasSponsoring`.
>
> **Third-party caveat:** Some non-Radius facilitators may differ in supported networks,
> response shape, or EIP-2612 gas sponsoring behavior. Verify their `/supported`, `/health`,
> `/verify`, and `/settle` behavior before using them in production.

### Alternative facilitators

Use Radius-operated facilitators by default. These third-party facilitators may be useful for
fallbacks, testing, or routing, but their supported methods and response shapes can differ:

| Facilitator | URL | Networks | Notes |
|-------------|-----|----------|-------|
| Stablecoin.xyz | `https://x402.stablecoin.xyz` | Mainnet + testnet | Hosted facilitator tooling |
| FareSide | `https://facilitator.x402.rs` | Testnet only | May require Permit2 pre-approval for fresh wallets |
| Middlebit | `https://middlebit.com` | Mainnet | Multi-facilitator routing and analytics |

For chain definitions, RPC URLs, and explorer URLs, see the **radius-dev** skill.

### Server-side config object

**Mainnet:**
```typescript
const x402Config = {
  asset: '0x33ad9e4BD16B69B5BFdED37D8B5D9fF9aba014Fb',
  network: 'eip155:723487',
  payTo: process.env.PAYMENT_ADDRESS!,          // your wallet
  facilitatorUrl: 'https://facilitator.radiustech.xyz',
  facilitatorApiKey: process.env.FACILITATOR_API_KEY, // optional
  amount: '100',                                // 0.0001 SBC per request
};
```

**Testnet:**
```typescript
const x402Config = {
  asset: '0x33ad9e4BD16B69B5BFdED37D8B5D9fF9aba014Fb',
  network: 'eip155:72344',
  payTo: process.env.PAYMENT_ADDRESS!,
  facilitatorUrl: 'https://facilitator.testnet.radiustech.xyz',
  amount: '100',
};
```

### Client-side defaults

```typescript
// Mainnet
const RADIUS_DEFAULTS = {
  chainId: 723487,
  tokenAddress: '0x33ad9e4BD16B69B5BFdED37D8B5D9fF9aba014Fb',
  tokenName: 'Stable Coin',
  tokenVersion: '1',
  tokenDecimals: 6,
  permit2Address: '0x000000000022D473030F116dDEE9F6B43aC78BA3',
  x402Permit2Proxy: '0x402085c248EeA27D92E8b30b2C58ed07f9E20001',
};

// For testnet, override chainId:
// const TESTNET_DEFAULTS = { ...RADIUS_DEFAULTS, chainId: 72344 };
```

## Pre-flight checks

Before writing integration code, verify the infrastructure is in place:

**1. Facilitator is reachable and supports your network**

```bash
# Mainnet
curl -s https://facilitator.radiustech.xyz/health | jq .status
curl -s https://facilitator.radiustech.xyz/supported | jq '.kinds[] | .network'

# Testnet
curl -s https://facilitator.testnet.radiustech.xyz/health | jq .status
curl -s https://facilitator.testnet.radiustech.xyz/supported | jq '.kinds[] | .network'
```

The `/supported` response confirms the facilitator handles your network, transfer method (`permit2`), and EIP-2612 domain values. See [facilitator-api.md](references/facilitator-api.md) for full response format.

**2. Wallet has SBC tokens**

```typescript
const balance = await publicClient.readContract({
  address: '0x33ad9e4BD16B69B5BFdED37D8B5D9fF9aba014Fb',
  abi: parseAbi(['function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)']),
  functionName: 'balanceOf',
  args: [walletAddress],
});
// balance is in 6-decimal raw units (e.g. 100000 = 0.1 SBC)
```

No SBC? Use the **dripping-faucet** skill to get tokens.

**3. Third-party facilitators: check Permit2 approval requirements**

Radius-operated facilitators support EIP-2612 gas sponsoring for first-time wallets. Some third-party facilitators may require fresh wallets to pre-approve the Permit2 contract before their first payment. See the [pre-approval helper](references/x402-client.md#third-party-facilitators-pre-approving-permit2).

**4. Wallet signing convention**

Follow the shared Radius wallet convention from the **radius-dev** skill:

- Fresh one-shot agent demos and terminal access should use `radius-cli wallet pay`.
- App-code clients should use `createRadiusFetch()` with a viem account or wallet client. Store any key material in the application's secrets system.
- [x402-cli-cast.md](references/x402-cli-cast.md) and `scripts/x402-pay.mjs` are legacy/specialized references for environments that cannot use `radius-cli`.
- Never request, log, hardcode, or pass raw private keys as CLI arguments such as `--private-key`.

## Operating procedure

### A. "I want to monetize my API with x402" (server-side)

1. **Install the seller dependencies** — `npm install radius-sdk hono`.
2. **Configure `radiusPayments()`** from `radius-sdk/hono` with an explicit network, recipient, route, and price. Follow the runnable [seller example](references/x402-server.md).
3. **Test the endpoint behavior** — `curl` your local or already-hosted endpoint to verify it returns 402 with the intended requirements.
4. **Handle settled requests** — the default `settle: 'before'` runs the handler after settlement. Record the payment context or use `onSettled` where the application needs it.
5. **Get discovered** — register your service with x402 discovery endpoints so agents and buyers can find it programmatically. Facilitators that implement the `/discovery/resources` convention serve a machine-readable catalog of available services. See [x402-client.md § Discovering services](references/x402-client.md#discovering-x402-services) for the response format and known discovery endpoints.
6. **Deploy separately if needed** — after local or existing-host validation, invoke the user's Cloudflare, Wrangler, Railway, or platform-specific skill to deploy. Do not stop at "deployment is out of scope" when the user explicitly asks for deployment; hand off after the x402 behavior is correct.

### B. "I want to consume a paid x402 API" (client-side)

**Default agent/CLI path:** use `radius-cli wallet pay <verb> <url>` from a
wallet scope controlled by `RADIUS_HOME`.

```bash
RADIUS_HOME=.radius RADIUS_NETWORK=testnet \
  radius-cli wallet pay get https://example.com/paid \
  --threshold 0.001 \
  --json \
  -y
```

`radius-cli` handles the full flow (request endpoint, parse 402
`PAYMENT-REQUIRED`, select a compatible `accepts` entry, sign the required x402
payload, retry with payment headers, and print the paid response). It is the
preferred path for agents consuming x402 endpoints.

`--threshold` is expressed in display units such as SBC, not raw 6-decimal
integer units. Always set it for non-interactive agent runs; the command should
refuse to pay if the endpoint asks for more than the threshold. Use `-y` only
after the threshold and target URL are explicit.

Common request forms:

```bash
radius-cli wallet pay post https://example.com/paid \
  --threshold 0.01 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"radius"}' \
  --json \
  -y
```

Set `RADIUS_RPC_URL` or `RADIUS_SBC_ADDRESS` when you need to override the
network defaults for a local or custom environment.

1. **Discover services** — query `/discovery/resources` endpoints to find available x402 services programmatically. See [x402-client.md § Discovering services](references/x402-client.md#discovering-x402-services) for code and known endpoints. Any HTTP endpoint that returns 402 with a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header is also an x402 service — the 402 response itself is a discovery mechanism.
2. **Request the endpoint** — receive 402 with payment requirements in the `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header
3. **Use the SDK for app code** — call `createRadiusFetch()` from `radius-sdk/client` with `signer`, `network`, and the required `maxPerRequest`. The client chooses a compatible offer and signs the correct payload. See [x402-client.md](references/x402-client.md).
4. **Inspect the result** — read `getPaymentReceipt(response, payFetch.network)` and reconcile the transaction when settlement evidence is required. An HTTP 2xx response alone is not payment proof.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Used by | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PAYMENT_ADDRESS` | Server | Server | Wallet address that receives SBC payments |
| `FACILITATOR_API_KEY` | No | Server | Optional API key for the facilitator |
| `RADIUS_HOME` | Client CLI | Client | Project/agent-scoped `radius-cli` wallet state directory |
| `RADIUS_NETWORK` | Client CLI | Client | Radius network for `radius-cli` operations, usually `testnet` or `mainnet` |
| `RADIUS_RPC_URL` | Client CLI/app code | Client | Optional RPC override for custom environments |
| `RADIUS_SBC_ADDRESS` | Client CLI/app code | Client | Optional SBC token override; defaults to Radius SBC |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | Client app code | Client | Environment-provided private key for viem signing; never inline or log this |

## Gotchas

| Pitfall | Wrong | Right |
|---------|-------|-------|
| SBC decimals in amount | `"1000000000000000000"` (18 dec) | `"100"` (6 dec = 0.0001 SBC) |
| **Permit2 spender (critical)** | Using Permit2 contract or payTo | Spender = **x402 Proxy** (`0x4020...0001`). This is the field the facilitator always validates. |
| EIP-2612 domain name | `"SBC"` or `"Stablecoin"` | `"Stable Coin"` (exact, with space). Matters for first payment from a wallet (establishes Permit2 allowance on-chain). |
| EIP-2612 spender | Using payTo address or x402 Proxy | Spender = **Permit2 contract** (`0x0000...8BA3`). Matters for first payment. |
| Assuming every offer needs two signatures | Always sign EIP-2612 + Permit2 | Follow the advertised version, scheme, and transfer method. A sponsored Permit2 offer uses both signatures; EIP-3009 and other offers differ. |
| **EIP-2612 `value` ≠ selected payment `amount`** | `value: 2n**256n - 1n` (max uint256) | For a sponsored Permit2 offer, `value` must equal the selected requirement's `amount`. The Radius x402 Proxy can revert `Permit2612AmountMismatch()`; reconcile the on-chain receipt. |
| Wrong network facilitator | Using the mainnet facilitator for testnet or the testnet facilitator for mainnet | Use `https://facilitator.radiustech.xyz` for `eip155:723487` and `https://facilitator.testnet.radiustech.xyz` for `eip155:72344` |
| Third-party first-time wallet | Assuming every facilitator sponsors first-time Permit2 approval | Check `/supported`; if sponsoring is unavailable, use the SDK's approval flow or an explicit Permit2 approval transaction before payment |
| Address casing | Comparing addresses with `===` | Always compare case-insensitively or normalize with viem's `getAddress()` |
| Missing EIP-2612 nonce | Hardcoding nonce to 0 | Read from token: `nonces(address)` on SBC contract |
| Permit2 nonce | Sequential nonce | Random nonce (crypto random bytes) |
| Expired deadline | Static deadline from build time | Compute at sign time: `Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 300` |
| `accepts` vs `accepted` | Sending the full server `accepts` array as `accepted` | Server returns `accepts: [...]`; client sends one selected requirement as singular `accepted: {...}` |
| Hand-written integer JSON | Writing final payload `uint256` fields as numbers | Use decimal strings for final payload integer fields, e.g. `"amount": "100"` |
| Non-viem EIP-712 signing | Omitting `EIP712Domain` from typed-data `types` | Include `EIP712Domain` when signing with tools such as `cast wallet sign --data` |

> **Testing insight:** The facilitator validates the Permit2 signature on every request. The EIP-2612
> gas sponsoring signature is used on-chain to establish the Permit2 contract's token allowance.
> After a wallet's first successful payment, subsequent payments may succeed even with an incorrect
> EIP-2612 signature because the Permit2 allowance already exists. Always get both signatures right
> — the EIP-2612 error will surface on the first payment from any new wallet. For first payments,
> also confirm the on-chain receipt of `settlementResponse.txHash`: facilitator `success: true`
> reflects that the settle tx was submitted, not that it succeeded on-chain.
